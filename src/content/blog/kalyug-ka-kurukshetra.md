### Prelude

On the battlefield of Kurukshetra, a warrior named Arjuna once stood paralyzed, torn between duty and morality. Beside him stood Shri Krishna—divine incarnate, his charioteer, his guide, and the voice of wisdom, urging him toward clarity and action.

But what if, instead of divine counsel, one was met with the opposite?

This is an alternate take on that fateful conversation, where **Dante**, the seeker of meaning, is not guided by wisdom, but challenged by cynicism. His companion? The **Devil**—not a savior, but a tempter, not a guide, but a voice that thrives in doubt.

One pleads for peace, the other mocks its frailty. What unfolds is a battle of words, sharp, witty, and unsettling, revealing the eternal struggle between conflict and purpose, destruction and creation, war and the weight of peace itself.

*For if Kurukshetra was a war of duty, this is the Kurukshetra of doubt.*

### Somewhere on Gaia

**Dante**

Tell me, Why does humanity cling to war? Why do we march toward death when peace is within reach, waving at us like an old friend we keep ignoring?

**Devil**

Because war is not born of hatred, but of hunger. Hunger for power, for meaning, for control. <br/>
Peace? Peace is needy, Peace is fragile, fleeting.It demands restraint, humility.<br/>
But War,<br/>
War promises glory, purpose and the illusion of permanence

**Dante**

Yet it brings ruin,suffering and endless grief. Can humanity not evolve beyond such destruction?

**Devil**

Destruction is in your blood. To tear down is to create anew. <br/>
You seek peace, but what you crave is conquest of your fears, your doubts, your morality. <br/>
War is not always fought with swords; sometimes, it's waged in the mind.<br/>
The question is not whether war is necessary, but whether you can bear to face the battles within yourself.

**Dante**

So, we are destined to war within and without?

**Devil**

War is the shadow of humanity's search for meaning <br/>
If you wish for peace, first ask yourself: Can you stand to live without purpose?<br/>
Without a fight to justify your existence?

For some, peace is the greatest war of all.

## Introduction
Some words just get you - like an old friend who knows exactly what to say at the right moment. Throughout my life, there are a few pieces that really resonate with me. These pieces capture my essence better than I ever could. These are the  pieces without any order that I find myself coming back again and again to reignite  the feeling of serendipity. To you,the reader,I hope you find something worthwhile that would tickle your thoughts and maybe help you feel better ðŸ˜ƒ


## The Road not Taken - Robert Frost

> The poem that got hold of the 14 year old me and still holds me in its grasp

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both <br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood <br/>
And looked down one as far as I could <br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br/>

Then took the other, as just as fair, <br/>
And having perhaps the better claim, <br/>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br/>
Though as for that the passing there <br/>
Had worn them really about the same, <br/>

And both that morning equally lay <br/>
In leaves no step had trodden black. <br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back. <br/>

I shall be telling this with a sigh <br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br/>
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference. <br/>


## Ozymandias -  by Percy Shelley  
> I discovered this poem in my school text book. Though it was small and was insignificant, this sonnet hooked me for some reasons

I met a traveller from an antique land,  
Who saidâ€”â€œTwo vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away."  

## Do not go gentle into that Good Night - Dylan Thomas  
> I first head this in the film **Interstellar** by *Christopher Nolan*. A hymn for spacefaring explorers and pioneers;Holy music for those who dare to reach beyond

Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br />

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words had forked no lightning they  
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />  

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />  

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, 
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, 
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />  

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />  

And you, my father, there on the sad height, 
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. 
Do not go gentle into that good night. 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 

## Conclusion

Congratulations if you've made it to the end! ðŸŽ‰
Of course, this isn't the final versionâ€”far from it. I'll keep adding more verses that captivate me as I stumble upon them.
Poetry is a journey, not a destination, and who knows? Maybe the next line I find will be the one that stays with me forever.
